Photoshop CS5 Scripts
================================

The following scripts can be used to extend the functionality of Photoshop.

Install them in Scripts folder then access them via the Filemenu within Photoshop: File -> Scripts -> Name of Script e.g. File -> Scripts -> Export for Mobile.

I couldn't get it working in Windows 64 bit Photoshop but that might be because I modified the scripting system in order to prevent 64bit Photoshop from disabling Flash Player trace() logging (a known bug).


Installation
-------------------------

Windows 32bit: C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS5\Presets\Scripts\

Windows 64bit: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS5\Presets\Scripts\
